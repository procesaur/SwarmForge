# SwarmForge
Swarm forge is a windows application designed to ease the testing of different particle swarm parameter value combinations and setups in order to explore result differences in facility location problems (with p-medain and p-center solution options).

Some of the options included are:
-dataset reconstruction
-particle swarm movement limitations adjustments
-particle swarm orientation and tendency adjustments
-different algorithm stop options
-display of multiple resulted metrics

It is supposed to help in narrowing down parameter option for different problems trough testing on different datasetes (40 of them) which are included in the project and are acquired from OR-Library [Copyright (c) (2010) (J E Beasley}](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/legal.html).

## Basic information on solution shape and origin
This git contains complete fileset of a Visual Studio solution (.sln) project (x64, visual C#, windows forms application).
Starting and editing of the project in this form requires Micorsoft Windows, suitable version of [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (VS2015 and VS 2017 certany work), suitable x64 machine, and a suitable version of Microsoft .NET framework ([4.5]() and higher).

## Contributing and versioning
Currently the code has only one version (this one) and only one contributor (me), but others are welcome to join in.
